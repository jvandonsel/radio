# Streaming Radio Appliance

## Overview
This is a streaming radio appliance built inside the chassis of a Tivoli Audio Model One radio.  All electronics in the original radio were removed, and this project uses only:
- Speaker
- Volume knob
- Band switch
- Tuning knob

The tuning knob on the Model one is especially nice. It's big and is geared way down.  It originally was tied to a variable capacitor for RF tuning purposes, but here I've connected it to a 10K potentiometer which is monitored by an A/D converter.

## Hardware
I used the [Libre Potato](https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/) as my main controller. It's very similar to a Raspberry Pi 4.  It has no WiFi, so a cheap WiFi USB adapter was added.

## Software
